# Introducing GebetaMaps Tile Service: Your World, Your Way

We're thrilled to announce the official launch of GebetaMaps Tile Service, bringing powerful, customizable mapping capabilities to developers worldwide. After months of rigorous development and testing, our tile service is ready to transform how you incorporate location intelligence into your applications.

## Why Tiles Matter

Maps are more than just pretty visuals—they're essential tools for understanding our world. At GebetaMaps, we believe that the foundation of any great mapping application begins with high-performance tile delivery:

- **Speed matters**: Our optimized tile delivery ensures your maps load lightning-fast, even in challenging network conditions
- **Flexibility is key**: Customize every aspect of your maps to match your brand and vision
- **Details make the difference**: Access high-resolution imagery and data when and where you need it

## What Sets GebetaMaps Tiles Apart

While there are other mapping solutions available, GebetaMaps Tiles offers distinct advantages:

### Local Data Integration
Seamlessly blend global map data with your proprietary information, creating context-rich visualizations that tell your unique story.

### Style Without Limits
Our styling engine goes beyond basic customization, allowing you to control every visual element from colors to typography to terrain shading.

### Performance-First Architecture
Built from the ground up with performance in mind—because we know that in mapping, every millisecond counts.

## Implementation in Just a Few Lines

```jsx
import { GebetaMap, MapStyles } from '@gebetamaps/react';

function MyMapComponent() {
  const mapRef = useRef(null);

  return (
    <GebetaMap
      mapRef={mapRef}
      style={MapStyles.MODERN}
      apiKey={import.meta.env.VITE_GEBETA_API_KEY}
      center={[9.005401, 38.763611]} // Addis Ababa coordinates
      zoom={11}
      width="100%"
      height="100%"
      markers={[
        {
          id: "marker-1",
          lngLat: [9.005401, 38.763611],
          imageUrl: "your-marker.png",
          imageSize: { width: 35, height: 35 },
          onClick: () => { //do something }
        }
      ]}
    />
  );
}
