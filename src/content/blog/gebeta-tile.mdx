# Introducing Gebeta Maps' New Map Tiles: A Game Changer for African and Emerging Market Mapping

At Gebeta Maps, we've always been driven by a simple goal---making maps more accessible, reliable, and truly local. When we first started, we focused on providing mapping services that developers could use alongside other map tile rendering providers. But we knew this wasn't a complete solution. Our users still had to rely on multiple services, which added complexity.

This is not just another update. This is a game-changer. For the first time, we are fully independent in delivering fast, high-quality maps tailored to Africa's unique needs. Until now, we provided mapping services, but we still relied on third-party map tiles rendering. Those meant businesses using our services had to depend on other providers for rendering, limiting flexibility and increasing costs. But today, that changes. We now control the full mapping experience---from data collection to rendering---offering a complete, all-in-one solution that is fast, affordable, and locally optimized.

This has been a long time coming, and we've worked hard to make it happen based on feedback from our users. We believe maps should be built for the people who use them, and this release brings us one step closer to that vision.

## What is a Map?

Maps have shaped human history. From the earliest hand-drawn maps used by explorers to the sophisticated digital maps we use today, they have been essential tools for navigation, trade, and development.

But maps today are so much more than just visual guides. They power ride-hailing apps, help businesses deliver goods efficiently, and assist governments in urban planning. Modern digital maps rely on advanced rendering technology that ensures they load quickly, work smoothly, and display accurate data in real time.

A great map is more than just a picture---it is an intelligent system that adapts, updates, and guides millions of people and businesses every day.

## What is Map Tile Rendering and Why is This a Big Deal?

Maps have always been essential for how we navigate the world---whether it's finding a new restaurant, planning a delivery route, or mapping out entire cities. But digital maps don't just appear on your screen all at once. They are made up of small square pieces called tiles---like a giant puzzle. When you open a map, only the pieces you need at that moment load, making everything faster and smoother. The process of putting these pieces together in real time is called map rendering.

For years, only a few big companies---Google Maps, Mapbox, OpenStreetMap, and a handful of others---controlled this technology. If businesses or developers in Africa wanted to use maps, they had to depend on these providers. The problem? Their maps were expensive, they often lacked important local details, and worst of all, the data that should belong to us was under the control of foreign companies. This meant that any time we needed access to mapping information about our own roads, businesses, and communities, we had to rely on an outside platform. That never felt right to us.

So, we decided to change that.

Building a full-scale mapping platform is one of the hardest technological challenges out there---only a handful of companies in the world have done it. But we believed that Africa deserved a world-class mapping system that was truly built for us, by us. A map that reflects our cities as they grow, supports our businesses as they expand, and gives governments, developers, and everyday people the tools they need without forcing them to depend on expensive foreign providers.

Now, that vision is a reality. With our own map rendering technology, we own the entire experience---from the data itself to how it is displayed and used. This allows us to provide faster, more affordable, and fully customizable maps designed specifically for Africa's needs.

But this is about more than just better technology. **This is about independence.** For the first time, we are no longer at the mercy of outside platforms when it comes to mapping our own world. We are taking back control of our own data, our own cities, and our own future.

And the most exciting part? **We're just getting started.**

## Why We Built This

Many mapping solutions available today either lack local details or are too expensive for businesses and developers in emerging markets. This makes it difficult for them to build location-based services that truly reflect their surroundings.

We built Gebeta Maps to bridge this gap. Our goal is to provide affordable, highly localized, and customizable maps that accurately represent the landscapes and cities where people live and work.

Accessing and distributing a country's own mapping data is often a challenge, and we understand how important it is for governments, businesses, and developers to have control over their own geographic information. That's why we are committed to solving these issues---not just for one country, but for the entire continent.

## What Does It Mean for Businesses?

For African companies, our mapping technology is more than just a technology---it's a revolution. Gebeta Maps understands that maps are the backbone of industries such as ride-hailing, logistics, e-commerce, and urban planning. Businesses have long relied on foreign platforms which never addressed the peculiar needs of our markets.

Most have struggled with outdated maps with significant omissions such as roads, informal settlements, and neighborhood markets. This inaccuracy in mapping creates inefficiencies in operations and opportunities missed. With our technology, we provide a truly local solution that reflects the evolving nature of African cities. We don't just provide roads and landmarks; we provide a dynamic system that evolves with our urban spaces.

Our approach empowers companies to be in full control of their operations and data. We let the startup, enterprise, or government agency innovate, create, and scale with ease, unconstrained by the constraints of legacy mapping platforms. With the power of self-hosting, organizations can maintain their confidential location data in their hands.

## Key Benefits

### 1. Faster and More Efficient
We designed our map tiles to load quickly by leveraging the power of users' devices for rendering. Instead of relying solely on external servers, our technology processes maps locally, making loading times much faster. This ensures a smooth and seamless experience, whether you're using a logistics platform, an e-commerce app, or any other location-based service.

### 2. Cost-Effective Pricing
High mapping costs often come from expensive server infrastructure. By optimizing local rendering and processing, we've significantly reduced these costs---allowing us to offer a more affordable pricing model without compromising on quality. With Gebeta Maps, businesses can now access high-quality maps at a fraction of the cost of traditional providers.

### 3. Improved Local Coverage
Many global mapping providers lack detailed data for African cities, often missing key roads, landmarks, and informal settlements. Our map tiles are built with extensive local data, ensuring accurate and reliable coverage that truly represents the areas where people live and work.

### 4. Customizable for Your Needs
Every business has unique needs when it comes to maps. That's why we offer fully customizable tiles, allowing you to adjust the design, colors, and styles to match your brand and functional requirements.

Additionally, we provide self-hosting options for organizations that require enhanced security and data privacy. With Gebeta Maps, governments, financial institutions, and enterprises can run a world-class mapping solution on their own infrastructure---giving them full control over their data without relying on external providers. It doesn't get better than that!

### 5. Offline Capabilities
Reliable internet access isn't always guaranteed in emerging markets. That's why our map tiles are designed to work offline, ensuring that businesses and users can still navigate and access important location data even when connectivity is limited.

## Who Can Benefit from This?

- **Developers & Startups**: Easily integrate fast, reliable, and affordable maps into applications.
- **Logistics & Delivery Companies**: Optimize routes and navigation for better efficiency.
- **E-commerce Businesses**: Improve customer experiences with precise location-based services.
- **Government & NGOs**: Utilize accurate maps for urban planning, infrastructure projects, and public services.

## How to Get Started

Here’s a quick example of how you can integrate Gebeta Maps into your application:

```jsx
import { GebetaMap, MapStyles } from '@gebetamaps/react';

function MyMapComponent() {
  const mapRef = useRef(null);

  return (
    <GebetaMap
      mapRef={mapRef}
      style={MapStyles.MODERN}
      apiKey="your api key"
      center={[9.005401, 38.763611]} // Addis Ababa coordinates
      zoom={11}
      width="100%"
      height="100%"
      markers={[
        {
          id: "marker-1",
          lngLat: [9.005401, 38.763611],
          imageUrl: "your-marker.png",
          imageSize: { width: 35, height: 35 },
          onClick: () => { //do something }
        }
      ]}
    />
  );
}
```
